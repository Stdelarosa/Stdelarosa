# Hi, I'm Saint!

## Professional Overview

Hey, I'm Saint. I currently work in operations support, where I focus on optimizing workflows, analyzing data, and supporting strategic decision-making. I'm actively building a foundation in data analysis, governance, automation, and reporting using tools like Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI.

My long-term goal is to become a Chief Data Officerâ€”leading efforts to turn raw data into actionable insights that serve the public good. I'm especially interested in how strong data infrastructure, ethical stewardship, and cross-functional collaboration can drive better decisions at both organizational and civic levels.

Right now, I'm transitioning into data operations roles where I can work with high-impact teams and scale my influence.
